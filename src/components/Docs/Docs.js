            <br />Cosmos doesn't keep any user or guild information by default. It doesn't need any personal information to function normally. This exception breaks, when a user subscribes for Astronomy Picture Of the Day(APOD) service.
            <br />
            <br /> When you subscribe to APOD service, we store the following Discord data:
            <br />
            <span className="purple"> - Discord Channel ID.</span>
            <br />
            <br />If the user unsubscribe, then we delete all the data that we have stored previously. If you have any questions or feel bad about the information, what we store, feel free to tell us why by reporting it through Cosmos or contacting with us on our <a href='https://discord.gg/XX9p5qUkuj'>support server</a>.
            <br />
